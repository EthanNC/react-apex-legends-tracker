# React Apex Stat Tracker

Inspiration was ![Apex Legends Tracker App | Full Stack Node & Vue.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z2qRln9tnc)

Decided to convert this tutorial into React app using Hooks. Was able to practice express development. Used styled components to achieve same styling as done in the tutorial.
